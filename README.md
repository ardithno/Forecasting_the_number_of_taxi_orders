# Forecasting the number of taxi orders

## ***Introduction*** ### *Project Description:* The company "Chyotenkoe Taxi" collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. In order to attract more drivers during peak periods, it is necessary to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. Submit a model for such a prediction.
The value of the RMSE metric when selecting tests should be no more than 48. ### *Project Goal:* Build a model for predicting the number of taxi orders for the next hour.
### *Data Description:* Data in the taxi.csv table: datetime - data collection date num_orders - number of orders ### *Work Plan:* 1. Data preparation: - data upload, general information study - creation of new features - stationarity testing 2. Data analysis: - exploratory analysis - correlation analysis 3. Model training 4. Testing 5. General conclusion
